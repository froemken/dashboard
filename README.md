## About Dashboard

This is a very small PHP Dashboard based on Laravel.

- Show current IP address
  - It's possible to use Google Cloud Function to get real IP
    instead of docker IP
- Show current timestamp
- Show DNS records of a domain

This project is at a very early state and should not be used in prod environments.

It's not possible to add your own widgets. Everything here is hard-coded.
